      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this personal website is to serve as a comprehensive landing page for prospective employers, 
         showcasing my front-end development skills and providing a platform for sharing and storing personal
         projects. With a clean and modern design, the website will serve as a digital resume accessible through links 
         on various online profiles, such as LinkedIn, and through QR codes on physical resumes. The website will also 
         provide an introduction to the creator and their programming goals, allowing potential employers to better 
         understand their background and interests even before the interview process.</p>

        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This site is unique because it is all about me! There isnâ€™t anywhere else on the internet that acts as a personal
        landing page where employers to come and learn about me and my work as a developer. Employers will be able to learn 
        a little bit about me and why I decided to become a programmer, the things I am currently working through and 
        learning, as well as have access to information and code for the projects I have worked on that could benefit their 
        sites. It will also showcase my skills with html, CSS, and JavaScript through the website design and functionality.
        
        First, employers will expect to find a personalized tone in my website that will set it apart from my other 
        accounts such as LinkedIn or GitHub. I will use the home page as an introduction to who I am, why I choose to 
        work in this field, as well as some of the goals that I have for development. It will showcase a fun little 
        project on the first page that immediately draws the attention of employers to my skills in a creative way.
        It will be clear on each page, including this one, how the employer can contact me as well as links to other 
        important sites that contain my information.

      </ul>
      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        The next page will allow clear access to the projects I have worked on both in my personal time as well as 
        projects from my classes that I am proud of. Each page will have an image that represents the project such 
        as a screenshot at runtime or the home page of another web application.  Each project will include a small 
        definition as well as a link to the code on GitHub and a website URL if necessary. This page will need access 
        to the projects I have been working on and so I will need to incorporate some organizational skills in order 
        to complete this part.

      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, the website will include a page with updated blog posts about the things I am learning, the 
        questions I am wrestling with, and other interesting developments in my programming journey. This page 
        will include the ability to select a date based on when I update an entry. This will be an interesting 
        page because it will show employers that I am actively seeking knowledge and am up to date in the industry.
